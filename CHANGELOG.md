CHANGELOG
===============
**25th May, 2017**
- Route picker: buttons to select a route activated. Touch the map anywhere to clear selection.
- The route prompt line displays annotated name of currently selected route.

**24th May, 2017**
- Map display improved, thanks to [osmdroid sample code](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/tree/master/OpenStreetMapViewer).
- Route Manager button now leads to a very basic browser activity, which will finally become the Route Picker (main activity of the Route Manager).
- Route Creator attached to the Route Manager menu. Save button active, adds the just created route to Data.mRoutesGpx.

**23rd May, 2017**

- All the code imported into a fresh Android Studio project, to finally get rid of the old app rudiments. Project shared from scratch.

**22nd May, 2017**

- MainActivity (together with the FileBrowser) added, needs further adaptation. At the moment the POI Manager button does nothing (this isn't going to change soon), and the Route Manager button leads temporarily to the Route Creator activity.
