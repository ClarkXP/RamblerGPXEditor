CHANGELOG
===============
###24th May, 2017
- Map display improved.
- Route Manager button now leads to a very basic browser activity, which will finally become the Route Picker (main activity of the Route Manager).
- Route Creator attached to the Route Manager menu. Save button active, adds the just created route to Data.mRoutesGpx.

###23rd May, 2017
All the code imported into a fresh Android Studio project, to finally get rid of the old app rudiments. Project shared from scratch.

###22nd May, 2017
- MainActivity (together with the FileBrowser) added, needs further adaptation. At the moment the POI Manager button does nothing (this isn't going to change soon), and the Route Manager button leads temporarily to the Route Creator activity.
