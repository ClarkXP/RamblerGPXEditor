Rambler GPX Editor
===================================

This project is an attempt to create a GPX editor, based on existing commercial application code, 
but this time using opensource APIs and open data. 

At the moment the project has just one useful activity, which is a Route Creator, drawing a route between Start, Mid-points 
and Finish on the basis of Open Street Routing Machine data returned by the OSRM Demo Server.

As soon as this sandbox starts working well enough, I'll start re-implementing the rest of existing activities,
 and adding them to the project:

- Routes Manager;
- Route Editor;
- Route Simplifier;
- POI (Points Of Interest) Manager;
- *Enter an idea here*.
